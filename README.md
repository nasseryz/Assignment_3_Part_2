<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Titanic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/RMS_Titanic_3.jpg/2560px-RMS_Titanic_3.jpg)

In this project, we performed exploratory data analysis and answered three hypotheses based on the dataset. We used statistics to analyze this data.
Here are three possible hypotheses:
* The survival rate is associated with the class of passenger
* The survival rate is associated with the gender
* The survival rate is associated with the age
And For each hypothesis, we have a plot.


### Prerequisites

We need Pandas and MatPlotLib packages to perform analysis and draw plots.

  ```sh
  import pandas as pd
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  ```
